Git - version control
Working Directory:
Staging Area: Staged for addition, Staged for removal
Commits:
Blobs: Blob 0 (what is read in Hello.txt)
Trying to track the versions of the files, not the file name

Adding: staging file for addition (or removal)


Init: initialize a directory, a file
Add: adds files to the staging area

Super Class: Working Directory
Subclasses: Staging Area, Commits, Blobs

Instance Variables: variables that hold the hashcodes
Methods: Hash Function (using Sha1),

Staging area and the commit area are things that exist in the repository
When you initialize in the repository, there is a hidden gitlet folder that holds everything for gitlet program
Commit area is the commit tree, represents the snapshots of everything taken of the working directory
Working directory is the joint commit leaf


Trees commit of commits nodes would be commits

Not tree!
Just some structure in a “commit” class that includes the ability to…
Just have a pointer or access to its parent (previous commit), and contains its current commit
And then a method should be a hash function
And an instance variable should be holding the hash function output variable (maybe the commit message - like the byte array) for reference and maybe its parent’s byte array too
